<h2>FYP - Hand Gesture-Based Keyboard for the Blind - Gordon Thompson</h2>


<p>This repository has been created to host the app files for my FYP. The instructions for the installation and operation of the App can be found in the User Guide Chapter of my Report.</p>


## Steps to Run the App
### 1. Clone the project

### 2. Run the project
```shell
npm i
npm start
```

### 3. Install the `Moesif CORS \& CORS Changer' extension for your web browser
  - Turn on when using app

### 4. Press any of the `Get Started' or `Start' buttons to be directed to the Keyboard UI

The web browser that opens when the app has been locally deployed should look the same as figure below.
